# Instacart-SQL

A data analysis project using Python to help the online grocery store, Instacart, create a targeted marketing strategy and make data-driven decisions for the business.

# Overview

The Instacart stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their database along with their purchasing behaviors. Since they can't target everyone using the same methods, they want to target different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they have an effect on the sale of their products. This analysis will inform what this strategy might look like to ensure Instacart targets the right customer profiles with the appropriate products. 
# Main Objectives
Perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of Instacart's data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.

Clean and merge four data sets: orders, products, department, and customer data.

Analyze the data to answer questions for the marketing strategy team (i.e. busiest time of day,highest grossing days of the week, most loyal customers, among others).

Analyze the data to discover differences in user's ordering habits based various characteristics (such as region, income, familu status, number of dependants, among others).

Create customer profiles based on combinations of variables and analyze how their ordering behaviors may differ (i.e. married people, single people, young adults, seniors, among others).

# Data 

The data used in this project is an Instacart Online Grocery Shopping dataset from 2017. Customer and price data was fabricated specifically for this project.

# Tools

Language: Python
Libraries: pandas, numpy, os, matplotlib, seaborn, and scipy.
Sofwares: Anaconda, Jupyter Notebooks and Excel.

# Skills Demonstrated

### Cleaning data:
Checked and removed duplicates, addressed missing values and mixed/incorrect data types.

### Merging data: 
Selected and prepared data for merging, confirmed merge was successful, and exported final merge as a pkl file.

### Exploratory analysis:
Explored basic descriptive statistics (max/min, quartiles, mean, standard deviation) for each variable as well as using histograms, scatterplots, and bar and line charts to explore the distributions of data.

### Derived new variables: 
Grouped data by user, order, and department to allow exploration and analysis at each level; used aggregated data to create flags about user ordering habits (such as ‘new customer’, ‘loyal customer’, etc.); confirmed the new data created via crosstabs and value counts.

### Visualizing data: 
Used Matplotlib and Seaborn to create histograms, line charts, pie charts, and bar charts (vertical, horizontal, and stacked).

### Reporting results: 
Provided an Excel report that gave a summary of the whole project by documenting population flow, consistency checks, data wrangling, and column derivations, as well as explanations to the questions from marketing team.
